00:27:35	Nataliia Orlova:	Hello! Are we talking about styling in React today? 
If not, that is my question: how to do styling? I have app.css and index.css - how to work with that?

Just remember to import your new_css_file.css inside the NewComponent just like app.css is being imported in App.jsx
01:11:46	Thais Santos:	I’d add that traditional sites would reload the whole page when you navigate to let’s say contact form (if not on the same page). With SPA only parts of the web will reload, not the whole thing.
01:13:45	Thais Santos:	You’ll be introduced to routes in React soon which makes it behave just like the traditional, meaning each request may look like you’re moving to another page.

01:26:12	Thais Santos:	Yes, with SPA your request to backend should return json which will be your state to update the components
