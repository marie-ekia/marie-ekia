01:00:37	Jacek Roszkowiak:	then you can use bash and run Linux commands without all that Windows Admin hassle
01:01:01	Vivi:	@Jacek Roszkowiak I never used Linux, and I think I will spend much more time to understand Linux now. The Linus is installed here, but I dunno how to use it
01:02:41	Jacek Roszkowiak:	WSL 2 is Linux running on Windows, you will not need to learn anything really, only you need to make sure your VSCode terminal is let to bash(Linux) and you just run commands, like npx create-react-app
01:05:38	Jacek Roszkowiak:	@Vivi  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
